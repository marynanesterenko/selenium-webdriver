REVISION:
1. How can we perform advanced mouse interactions in Selenium?
   - we can use the Actions class by creating an Object of that Class;
   - with this Object we can use the various methods that exist in the Actions Class;
   - we can chain different methods together in sequence and use .build() .perform() to perform the sequence;

2. What are some of the methods in the Actions class and what do they do?
    - keyUp() - is used to release a specific Key on the keyboard essentially undoing keyDown()
    - keyDown() - is used to hold down or “press” a specific Key on the keyboard
    - scrollToElement() - lets you scroll to the WebElement passed as a parameter to this method
    - scrollByAmount() - lets you scroll by a specific amount of x and y pixels
    - moveToElement() - is used to move the “cursor” to a specific WebElement which is passed as a paramter
    - dragAndDrop() - will take the first argument of WebElement and drop it on the second WebElement argument
    - dragAndDropBy() - will take a WebElement and move it by an amount of pixels on the x and y axis
    - doubleClick() - this method will perform a double click (2 fast sequential clicks)
    - contextClick() - this method will perform a right click (context click) on the passed WebElement
    - build() - used when calling a sequence of events to “build the sequence”
    - perform() - used to actually perform the sequence of events
