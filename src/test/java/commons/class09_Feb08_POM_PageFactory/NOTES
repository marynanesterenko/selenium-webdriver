1. Understand Page Object Model
2. Learn PageFactory

REVISION:
1. How can we handle multiple tabs/windows with Selenium?
   In order to handle multiple tabs/windows with Selenium, we can use the following methods:
     - driver.getWindowHandle() - returns the window handle String for the currently active window;
     - driver.getWindowHandles() - returns a Set of all the currently open window handle Strings,
         we usually turn this set into an ArrayList so that it is easier to manipulate;
     - driver.switchTo.window() - will switch to the window handle which is passed as an argument to the method

2. How can we pick the exact window we want to switch to?
    - the strategy would be to find the session ID of the of the current (primary) browser window and store it to a String variable;
    - then, using the .getWindowHandles() method, we would get all the session IDs and store them into an ArrayList Object;
    - then we can iterate through the ArrayList using an enhanced for loop (it can also be a regular for loop);
    - then also need to add simple if statement inside the loop, where we would specify the condition,
      which will help us to verify various values to ensure the window we are switching to is the one we want to;

3. How can we go back from whatever window we are on to the original (primary) window?
    - first, we need to save the primary window handle in a String by using the .getWindowHandle() method;
    - after we are done manipulating the other window, we can switch back to the primary window by using the saved String variable;
    - we can also use the driver.switchTo().defaultContent(), which will bring us to the very first parent/primary window that we started from;

4. What is an iFrame?
    - iFrame is a web element, that essentially holds a separate HTML document within itself;
    - it is often referred to as “A document inside of a document”;

5. How can we handle an iFrame using selenium?
    1. We can use the driver.switchTo().frame()
    he frame method has a couple different implementations. You can pass a WebElement iFrame
        a index of the iFrame, otherwise the id or name of the iframe

    After switching to an iFrame how can we go back to the parent frame
    1. We can use the driver.switchTo().parentFrame() in order to go to the direct parent of the current frame.
    How can we get back to the primary parent if we are in a nested iFrame (If we are inside of an iframe
    That’s inside of another iFrame)
    1. We can use the driver.switchTo().parentFrame() multiple times as necessary to make it back
    To the primary frame
    2. We can use driver.switchTo().defaultContent() which will bring us to the primary frame
