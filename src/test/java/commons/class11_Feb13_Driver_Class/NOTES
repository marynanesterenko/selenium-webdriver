AGENDA:
1. Implement Bonigarcia WebDriverManager into our Framework
2. Implement a config.properties file with some test/driver data
3. Set up runner files

REVISION:
How can we handle alerts using Selenium?
1. We can handle alerts using the Alert Interface
2. In order to manipulate an alert we need to create an instance of the Alert Interface

What are the methods inside of Alert interface and what do they do?
1. Alert.dismiss() - it will dismiss the alert. If there are two options on the alert
Such as accept or cancel. In that case the dismiss() method will select cancel.
2. Alert.accept() - it will select either the accept instead of cancel option or just close the alert
In the case that there arenâ€™t two options
3. Alert.getText() - which is returns the message inside of the alert
4. Alert.sendKeys() - is used to send a string of characters to the alert input IF THERE IS ONE

How can we create an instance of the Alert interface?
1. Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
2. Alert alert = driverWait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent()); - Kills two birds with one stone since
The ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent() method returns driver.switchTo().alert() once the alert is present
